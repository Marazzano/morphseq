I will not suggest any file changes at this time. I am waiting for you to add the files you want me to modify.

#### can we update the push the current state of this repo as a morphseq-segmentation-update-v1 branch before we start doing the refactor  

I cannot create or push branches to your repository. This action must be done through your Git client or platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). Please run the following commands locally:

```bash
git checkout -b morphseq-segmentation-update-v1
git push origin morphseq-segmentation-update-v1
```

Once you've done that, let me know and I’ll be ready to help with the refactor.

Understood. I will now wait for you to add the files you want me to modify. Once you send them, I will analyze the requests and suggest changes only in the files that need to be updated. I will not make any changes until you confirm the files are ready.

I cannot perform Git operations such as creating or pushing branches. Please create the `morphseq-segmentation-update-v1` branch using your local Git client. Once the branch is created and pushed, let me know so I can assist with the refactor.

I cannot perform git operations like creating branches or pushing code. Please create the `morphseq-segmentation-update-v1` branch yourself in your local repository and push the current state. Once done, let me know and I’ll help with the next steps.

#### what current branch are we in  

I cannot determine your current Git branch or perform Git operations like checking branches or creating new ones. Please check your current branch using `git status` or `git branch` in your terminal.

Once you've confirmed the current branch and created the `morphseq-segmentation-update-v1` branch, let me know and I’ll help you proceed with the changes.

#### give me an example of something you can do  

I can suggest changes to a file if you first add it to the chat.

For example, if you send me a file like this:

```
segmentation_sandbox/scripts/utils/embryo_metada_dev_instruction/embryo_metadata_utils.py
```

I can then analyze it and suggest specific edits, such as:
- Fixing a typo in a function name
- Improving a docstring
- Refactoring a loop for better readability
- Adding a missing type hint

But I cannot suggest changes without seeing the actual file content.

Please add the file you'd like me to review, and I’ll provide a full, properly formatted file listing with suggested changes.
