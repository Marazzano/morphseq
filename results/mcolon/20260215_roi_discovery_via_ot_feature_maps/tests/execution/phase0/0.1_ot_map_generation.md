# Task 0.1 — OT Map Generation

## Goal
Generate WT-referenced OT feature maps for all samples with reproducible provenance.

## Checks
- All expected samples produce map outputs without runtime failures.
- Manifest records stage window and OT parameter hash.
- Missing/corrupt inputs are listed explicitly.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Resolve sample manifest and WT reference.
2. Run OT map computation for each sample.
3. Persist maps + metadata contract.
4. Verify output count matches expected count.

## Outputs
- OT map arrays
- Generation summary report
