# Task 0.7 — Selection-aware Nulls + Stability

## Goal
Assess significance and robustness of Phase 0 localization outputs.

## Checks
- Permutation null shuffles labels at embryo level.
- Best-bin and best-interval null distributions are tracked.
- Bootstrap endpoint variability is summarized.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Compute observed best-bin and best-interval scores.
2. Run permutation loops with full selection repeated.
3. Run bootstrap resampling for interval endpoint stability.
4. Compute empirical p-values and CI summaries.

## Outputs
- Null distributions
- Bootstrap endpoint summaries
