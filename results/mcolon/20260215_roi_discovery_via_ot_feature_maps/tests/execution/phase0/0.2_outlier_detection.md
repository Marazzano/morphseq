# Task 0.2 — Outlier Detection + QC Gate

## Goal
Run and document Phase 0 outlier detection before downstream localization.

## Checks
- Default IQR detector runs on `total_cost_C` and emits thresholds.
- Outlier summary (counts, bounds, retained N) is saved to metadata.
- Worst-sample montage and dropped-sample table are generated.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Compute total OT cost per sample.
2. Run `outlier_detection.py` default detector (IQR).
3. Generate QC histogram/montage/table outputs.
4. Confirm retained sample set is used in later Phase 0 steps.

## Outputs
- Outlier summary JSON
- QC plots (`qc1`, `qc2`) and dropped-sample CSV (`qc3`)
