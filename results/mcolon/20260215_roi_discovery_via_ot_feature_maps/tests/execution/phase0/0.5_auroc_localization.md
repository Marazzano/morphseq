# Task 0.5 — AUROC Localization by Bin

## Goal
Quantify discriminability along body axis and identify high-signal regions.

## Checks
- Grouped CV prevents embryo leakage.
- AUROC per bin is reported with uncertainty.
- At least one bin exceeds initial discriminability sanity threshold.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Train/evaluate per-bin logistic models.
2. Compute AUROC profile for each feature.
3. Add bootstrap CI bands.
4. Persist bin-level score table.

## Outputs
- AUROC-by-bin table
- AUROC profile plot
