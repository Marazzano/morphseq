# Task 0.4 — S-bin Feature Aggregation

## Goal
Aggregate V0/V1 features per sample per S-bin for localization modeling.

## Checks
- Feature table contains all configured bins for each sample.
- V0 includes cost_mean; V1 adds displacement-derived features.
- Bin occupancy and NaN rate are reported.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Define K bins along S in [0,1].
2. Aggregate channel-wise means inside each bin.
3. Write long-form feature table.
4. Validate row counts and schema.

## Outputs
- `features_sbins.parquet`
- Feature summary diagnostics
