# Task 2.3 — OOB Bootstrap Occlusion + Threshold Sensitivity

## Goal
Estimate uncertainty for occlusion effect using true OOB bootstrap; inspect ROI threshold sensitivity.

## Checks
- Each replicate trains in-bag and evaluates OOB only.
- Empty/single-class OOB replicates are handled and logged.
- Threshold sweep `q ∈ {0.85, 0.90, 0.95}` is summarized.

## Pseudo-logic
1. For each bootstrap replicate: sample groups in-bag.
2. Refit fixed lambda/mu model and extract ROI at each q.
3. Compute OOB occlusion gap metrics.
4. Aggregate CI and positive-fraction stats.

## Outputs
- Bootstrap gaps array
- Threshold sensitivity summary
