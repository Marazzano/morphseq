# Task 2.5 — Integration Fixes (Addendum A)

## Goal
Close Phase-2-blocking integration gaps identified in addendum.

## Checks
- Driver config import path does not fail.
- Channel names/schema are carried into train result metadata.
- Shared `compute_logits` is used in Phase 1 and Phase 2 call sites.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Run import smoke tests for driver and config.
2. Train minimal run and inspect result metadata.
3. Static check for duplicated/inlined logits math in key modules.

## Outputs
- Integration checklist
- Import/runtime smoke logs
