# Task 2.1 — Perturbation + Fold-Safe Baseline

## Goal
Verify preserve/delete perturbation operators and train-fold-only baseline construction.

## Checks
- Baseline uses WT train/in-bag samples only.
- Preserve/delete equations produce correct shapes and mask behavior.
- Leakage warning emitted if full-dataset baseline is used diagnostically.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Build split with explicit train/OOB partition.
2. Compute baseline from train WT only.
3. Apply preserve/delete perturbations.
4. Validate values on hand-checked pixels.

## Outputs
- Baseline summary JSON
- Perturbation sanity report
