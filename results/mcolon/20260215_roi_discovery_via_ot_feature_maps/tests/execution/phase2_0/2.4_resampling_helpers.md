# Task 2.4 — Group-Aware Resampling Helpers

## Goal
Verify reusable resampling helper behavior across null/bootstrap workflows.

## Checks
- Resampling preserves group granularity.
- Stratified option maintains rough class balance.
- Helper flags degenerate OOB conditions.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Feed grouped labels into helper.
2. Draw many replicates.
3. Track in-bag/OOB group composition and class presence.
4. Validate emitted flags and determinism under fixed seed.

## Outputs
- Resampling diagnostics table
- Degeneracy frequency report
