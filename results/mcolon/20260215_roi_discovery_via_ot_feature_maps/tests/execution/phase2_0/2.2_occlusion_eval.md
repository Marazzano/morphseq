# Task 2.2 — Occlusion Evaluation Metrics

## Goal
Compute logit-gap and AUROC-based occlusion effects correctly.

## Checks
- `z_orig`, `z_delete`, `z_preserve` are computed with shared `compute_logits` utility.
- Primary metric `observed_gap` is reported on evaluation set.
- Single-class evaluation sets return AUROC=NaN with explicit logging.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Evaluate original and perturbed samples.
2. Compute per-sample and mean gaps.
3. Compute AUROC deltas when both classes exist.
4. Emit structured metrics table.

## Outputs
- Occlusion metrics table
- Evaluation log with edge-case notes
