# Task 2.5.2 — Dual Objective Behavior

## Goal
Ensure dual preserve-vs-delete objective behaves correctly on planted-signal data.

## Checks
- Objective increases when mask covers true signal region.
- Preserve score exceeds delete score on planted ROI examples.
- Regularization terms (`L1`, `TV`, optional entropy) are reported separately.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Build synthetic data with known ROI signal.
2. Evaluate objective for good vs bad masks.
3. Confirm monotonic score trend and regularizer effects.
4. Record objective decomposition.

## Outputs
- Objective comparison table
- Decomposition metrics JSON
