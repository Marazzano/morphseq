# Task 2.5.3 — Fixed-Model Mask Trainer

## Goal
Train a global mask against fixed classifier and confirm planted ROI recovery + tail plausibility.

## Checks
- Training objective improves over iterations.
- Learned mask overlaps planted ROI (IoU target from plan).
- Tail concentration inspection is logged for cep290-focused runs.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Freeze classifier weights.
2. Optimize global mask with dual objective + regularization + jitter.
3. Evaluate delete/preserve gaps and mask compactness.
4. Compute IoU and tail_fraction diagnostics.

## Outputs
- Learned soft/binary mask artifacts
- Training curve + summary JSON
