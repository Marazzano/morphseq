# Task 2.5.1 — Mask Parameterization Primitives

## Goal
Validate low-res parameterization, sigmoid mapping, upsampling, TV, and jitter utilities.

## Checks
- `m_param -> sigmoid -> m` stays in (0,1).
- Upsampled mask aligns with reference mask support.
- Jitter shifts are bounded and reproducible under seed.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Initialize low-res mask parameters.
2. Convert to soft mask and upsample.
3. Apply TV and jitter routines.
4. Validate ranges, shapes, and invariants.

## Outputs
- Primitive unit-check log
- Mask diagnostic images/arrays
