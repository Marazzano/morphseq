# Task 1.4 — TV Edge Construction + Computation

## Goal
Validate mask-aware total-variation definition and boundary behavior.

## Checks
- Edges include only valid pixel pairs inside `mask_ref`.
- Reduced-degree boundary behavior is observed.
- TV value is zero for uniform maps and positive for gradients.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Build small masked grid.
2. Enumerate valid neighbor edges.
3. Compute TV on known test patterns.
4. Compare with hand-computed expectations.

## Outputs
- Edge count diagnostics
- Boundary fraction report
