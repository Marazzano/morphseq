# Task 1.6 — ROI Extraction + Tail Concentration Inspection

## Goal
Verify quantile thresholding and component logic; inspect cep290 tail enrichment.

## Checks
- Quantile threshold produces expected area fraction range.
- Connected-component count is stable on synthetic maps.
- Tail inspection metric is computed and logged.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Extract ROI from `w_full` with default quantile.
2. Compute area_fraction, n_components, boundary_fraction.
3. Compute `tail_fraction` using predefined tail band.
4. Compare tail vs head/trunk fractions.

## Outputs
- ROI binary mask
- ROI metrics JSON (includes `tail_fraction`)
