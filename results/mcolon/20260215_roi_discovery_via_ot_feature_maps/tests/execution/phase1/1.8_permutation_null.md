# Task 1.8 — Permutation Null (Selection-Aware)

## Goal
Estimate null distribution while repeating selection logic under shuffled labels.

## Checks
- Label permutation happens at embryo-group level.
- For each permutation, the same selection workflow is applied.
- Report p-value for observed best score vs null max distribution.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Compute observed selected metric.
2. Loop B permutations: shuffle labels by embryo, rerun selection pipeline.
3. Store null maxima.
4. Compute empirical p-value.

## Outputs
- Null distribution array
- P-value report
