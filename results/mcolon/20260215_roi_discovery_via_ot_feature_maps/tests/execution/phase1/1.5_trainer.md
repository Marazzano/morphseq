# Task 1.5 — Trainer Convergence + Objective Logging

## Goal
Confirm optimizer decreases objective and localizes signal on planted data.

## Checks
- `total_objective` decreases from initialization.
- Logged components (`logistic`, `l1`, `tv`) are present.
- Learned weight map highlights planted signal region.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Build synthetic dataset with known discriminative region.
2. Train with fixed lambda/mu.
3. Track objective curve and final weight map.
4. Assert convergence and non-trivial localization.

## Outputs
- Training curve plot or CSV
- Final `w_full` snapshot
