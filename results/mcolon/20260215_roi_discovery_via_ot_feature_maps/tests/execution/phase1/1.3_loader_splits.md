# Task 1.3 — Loader + Grouped CV Splits

## Goal
Ensure embryo-grouped splitting prevents leakage and class weights are fold-local.

## Checks
- No embryo_id appears in both train/validation fold.
- Fold-local class weights use train data only.
- Filtering by QC flags is deterministic.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Construct synthetic groups with repeated snips per embryo.
2. Generate grouped folds.
3. Assert disjoint group sets and expected class distribution behavior.
4. Verify deterministic split under fixed seed.

## Outputs
- Fold index manifest
- Leakage check report
