# Task 1.10 — API Integration Smoke Test

## Goal
Validate `fit/plot/report` API path end-to-end on a tiny dataset.

## Checks
- API call chain completes without manual internal wiring.
- Run directory contains expected artifacts.
- Report includes selected hyperparameters and ROI summary.

## Pseudo-logic
1. Call `roi.fit(...)` on synthetic dataset.
2. Call `roi.plot(...)` and `roi.report(...)`.
3. Assert expected files exist and parse key summaries.

## Outputs
- End-to-end run folder
- Smoke test pass log
