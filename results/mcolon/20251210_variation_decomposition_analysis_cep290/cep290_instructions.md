we will look at 20251113, 20251106, 20251112

looking at cep290_pair_1, cep290_pair_2, cep290_pair_3

pairs 1,2 start high and go lower in termsof penetrance, and pair 3 starts low and goes higher. 
as such we want to use method descirribed in results/mcolon/20251210_variation_decomposition_analysis_cep290/Variance Decomposition.md to decompose variance into genetic, individual, and noise components.


keep the analysis and code you generate KISS and DRY. but reusable.
