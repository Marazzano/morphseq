so wanted to see if we could predict what the curvutre is in a mask from the embedding, it seems very possible. R2 of .81 without providing time and .83 when providing time as a feature.


interestingly gradient boosting did worse and had a R2 of .6 something, and it found different feature important than the ridge regression model...
