Goal here is to look at the phenotypes found from 'results/mcolon/20251219_b9d2_phenotype_extraction' 

I looked and saw that there were
- CE 
    - results/mcolon/20251219_b9d2_phenotype_extraction/phenotype_lists/b9d2-CE-phenotype.txt
- HTA  
    - results/mcolon/20251219_b9d2_phenotype_extraction/phenotype_lists/b9d2-curved-rescue.txt
- BA-rescue


HTA and BA-rescue look very simialr earlier on pre 60hpf, and then afterwatds the 

BA-rescue straightens out, i suspect that HTA and BA-rescue are actually the samephenotype
but the BA-resuce straightens out. 

I will use functionality src/analyze/difference_detection from as spoken in results/mcolon/20251218_difference_detection_permutation_testing_consolidation/PROPOSAL.md,
doing the analysis similar to results/mcolon/20251210_b9d2_earliest_prediction_analysis/output/figures/prediction_vs_divergence_comprehensive.png


so first i need to extract the embryo_id's names from these files and then incoportate these ids into the experiments. 

because HTA only appears after 60 hpf, we will only use expeirments 20251121 and 20251125

then we will do difference detection,

comaring each phenotype to all other embryos that have no phenotype (lets use wildtype embryos)

Then compare them to eachother.
