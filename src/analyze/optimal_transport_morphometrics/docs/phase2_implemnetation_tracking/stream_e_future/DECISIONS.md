# Stream E: Future Workstreams — Decisions

## Planned
- `timeseries_features.py` — extract scalar features from UOT results
- `field_embedding.py` — PCA on flattened velocity fields, clustering
- Permutation tests on transport field distances
- Temporal divergence analysis reusing `src/analyze/difference_detection/` framework
