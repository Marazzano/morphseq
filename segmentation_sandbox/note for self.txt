so i have the flags largely working, i see theres some dscontinuous masks

next step is to visualize these masks and see if the qc tests are actually detecint them correctly

oh maybe i can see if the video will work . 

so they video generator DID work now, problme being though that the mask from the sam2 model isnt correct

i need to see if the mask form the other branch worked differen or if its somehting wrong woth the model i general 


so i pulled up osme of the aarchive data and the problem is im getting worse segmentatio rsults on my data, im not sure why../
